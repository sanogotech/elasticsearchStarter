Springboot Integrate with ELK
This tutorial shows how to integrate springboot application with **ELK** and **Filebeat**.
The log messages generated by the springboot application will be sended into the 
local file and **Filebeat** will collect them and send them to the **Logstash** .
**Logstash** will send the log messages to **Elasticsearch** and then we can use
**Kibana** to show the log messages.

The **ELK** used in this tutorial are under the project folder.
